# 🐞 BugPatrol

BugPatrol is a **civic web platform** designed to streamline the process of reporting and resolving issues encountered on government websites. Whether it's related to **education, healthcare, public services**, or any other department, BugPatrol allows **citizens** to voice their concerns, while enabling **government tech teams** to track, manage, and resolve them effectively.

## 🌐 What is BugPatrol?

BugPatrol bridges the gap between civilians and government tech teams by providing a **dual-system interface**:
- 👤 **Civilians** can report bugs or problems they face on any government digital service.
- 🛠️ **Government tech teams** can access a dedicated dashboard to view, track, and resolve these issues.

To enhance accessibility:
- We integrated **Gemini API** for AI-powered **bug description generation** and **multi-language translation**, making it easier for users from diverse regions to submit accurate reports.
